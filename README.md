# test-games
Simple repo of test games to test features while developing boardgame library

This library is not meant to actually be used by anything, other than serving as an example games directory for testing `boardgame-util` and others. 

The contents in this directory were generated by `go mod init`, `boardgame-util config init` and `boardgame-util stub example`
